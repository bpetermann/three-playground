### Thanks
This project utilizes a 3D model from the Khronos Group's glTF Sample Models repository, specifically the MaterialsVariantsShoe model.<br />
Please note that the model was not made by me, nor do I own the rights to it.

Credit for the original model goes to the Khronos Group.<br />
You can find the model and other resources at the following link:
[Khronos Group GitHub](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/MaterialsVariantsShoe)

Changes were made to adapt the model for a simple shopping cart demo in three.js for a personal, non commercial, project.
